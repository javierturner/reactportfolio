                    Hi, I'm JT! I am a self-driven and creative Front End Web Developer with a background in Graphic Communications and Design. With great communication skills and the ability to work under pressure, I have been working as a Production Planner and Estimator for one of the largest printing and distributing companies in the Southeast for 3 years, providing cost estimates and project direction to the Wide Format department.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    After recently graduating from UNCâ€™s Full Stack Development program, I am excited to blend my knowledge of production and design with the new technologies I have learned.
